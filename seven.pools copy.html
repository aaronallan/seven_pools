					<h1>CURRENT PROJECTS</h1>
					<h3><b>Palapala Ho’omau Preservation Society</b><br/>Kipahulu, Maui, Hawaii</h3>
					<p>The historic Palapala Ho'omau Congregational Church is a serene sanctuary 
					on a high cliff overlooking the crashing Pacific. Built by missionaries in 1857, 
					the church and grounds are the burial place of generations of local Hawaiians, 
					Chinese plantation workers, and aviator Charles Lindbergh. The Palapala Ho’omau 
					Preservation Society was established in 2012 to restore the church, build an 
					endowment to maintain and return to an active role in the life of the Kipahulu 
					community. Seven Pools is creating a communications and fundraising plan for the 
					PPHS board to raise funds, to welcome and manage visitors to the historic graves, 
					and to open the church for select destination weddings and private events.</p>
					<h3><b>The Bishop Masereka Christian Foundation</b><br/>Kasese, Uganda</h3>
					<p>Seven Pools developed and implements a comprehensive communications strategy 
					for BMCF, a Ugandan-led grassroots initiative delivering  
					maternal-infant health care, malaria and HIV prevention and treatment to over 
					20,000 patients each year. BMCF is working with award-winning non-profit 
					architects MASS Design Group of the Partners in Health facility the Butaro Hospital 
					in Rwanda, to build the first modern hospital for western Uganda.<br/><br/>Seven Pools raises 										awareness of BMCF’s mission and plans fundraising appeals 
					for operations, a capital campaign for hospital construction, and materials for 
					major gifts solicitations, board meetings, and advocacy events. From concept 
					to delivery, we create newsletters, web content, videos, slide shows, and social 
					media to keep U.S. donors and partners engaged in BMCF’s progress and plans. 
					In 2012, two targeted appeals increased results over 2011 by 250%. Gale Pryor 
					wrote and produced ‘Making Motherhood Safer: The Bishop Masereka Hospital,’ 
					a video about the work of BMCF, in collaboration with Nesson Media. (View the 
					video at: <a href ="http://vimeo.com/52496985" target="_blank">Vimeo.</a>) Follow Seven Pools’ 										updates for BMCF on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/bmcfhealth" target="_blank">@bmcfhealth.</a> on Facebook:

					<h3><b>Innercity Weightlifting</b><br/>Boston, MA</h3>
					<p>Innercity Weightlifting reduces violence and promotes achievement among urban 
					youth at the highest risk for violence by getting them off the streets and into the gym 
					to learn the discipline of Olympic weightlifting. Gale Pryor led a team of graduate 
					students to create a communications strategy for Innercity Weightlifting to reach out to and build relationships in a community resistant to their mission. 
					<a href="http://www.innercityweightlifting.org" target="_blank">www.innercityweightlifting.org</a></p>
					<h3><b>East Boston Neighborhood Health Center</b><br/>Boston, MA</h3>
					<p>Gale wrote web and print content for an innovative community health center 
					serving 300,000 patients in East Boston and surrounding communities to express 
					the welcoming voice of the health center as well as inform and guide patients to 
					services. Gale’s interview with elders in community created an enduring portfolio of 
					profiles of the voices and stories of East Boston. <a href ="_/images/ESP.Testimonial.pdf" target="_blank">Elder Service Plan</a></p>
				
					<h3><b>Corporate Voices for Working Families</b><br/>Washington, D.C.</h3>
					<p>Gale wrote Workplace Lactation Programs: Good for Working Families, Good for Business, a print/online 							toolkit for managers and other administrators in corporations to support lower-wage employees who wish to breastfeed their babies after returning to work. We revised the toolkit to incorporate legislative developments based on Federal Affordable Care Act of 2010, then researched and wrote a new version, Lactation Toolkit for Commanders and Women in the Armed Services, in 2012. The project funded by grant from Abbott Laboratories.

				<h5>“Gale Pryor's commitment to her clients goes beyond what one would typically expect. 
				She not only asks thought-provoking questions and listens carefully to the responses, she 
				participates fully in the discovery process. Her genuine interest in, and ability to interact 
				with, a wide variety of audiences means she is able to delve deep into the soul of each 
				project and create an inspiring and insightful communications strategy—tailored to fit. Gale 
				sincerely cares about the quality and integrity of the message she is delivering, and delivers it 
				with perfection. I feel extremely lucky that I have had the opportunity to work with her and 
				hope there are more opportunities to do so in the future.”</h5><h6>—Erinn Larsen, graphic designer/art director</h6>

				questions, she would go off and return with copy that shows what a careful listener and 
				creative writer she is, for whatever she wrote was always just right. I could never figure out 
				how she could find just the words in just the style I was hoping for, but she did, time and 
				time again. Our books, authors, and illustrators benefited from her talents — and, on top 
				of it all, she is so easy and great fun to work with.”</h5><h6>—Deborah Sloan, Deborah Sloan and
